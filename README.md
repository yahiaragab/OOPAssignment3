This assignment will be an Android app that allows the user to drop a pin in a desired place, and navigate back to it by using the app, rather than having to remember exactly where the place is. Example: A user can drop a pin where ever he/she parked a car in a big parking lot, and not have to remember where it is, as long as a pin is dropped where to car is parked.
